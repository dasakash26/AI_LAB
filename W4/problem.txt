Look at the classical 8-puzzle problem and its solution from a particular given start state to a specific end state.



Write a Python program to solve the problem using Depth-first search in such a way that it can handle the 15-Puzzle problem
with the same program.

Provide necessary inputs to the program. Do not statically mention any of them inside the program.

Input and output states shall be written in the same file and you can read them properly as required.

Intermediate output shall be properly displayed and will be written in a separate output file.
